## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

# AgriLink
This is a repository for our 3rd year cs project

Abstract

Agriculture is the backbone of Kenya with a contribution of around 33% to the countryâ€™s GDP. 
However, over the years, sustainable agriculture production has been hampered by poor linkage 
between the producer and the market. Currently, more people have turned to farming due to 
high unemployment rates as a result of the pandemic; and with a record of heavy rains, most 
farmers have had high yield of harvest. However, poor linkage of production and market areas 
is an issue that has affected both the production areas and the market at large. Farmers in areas 
of high production are forced to sell their produce at low prices due to the glut in the market. 
While at the same time, there exists other regions where people are unable to access agricultural 
produce. The crops especially affected with this issue include: cabbages, potatoes, bananas, 
carrots and tomatoes. To solve this, we propose a web-based application that would notify 
farmers areas of potential market and the market areas with plentiful produce. The application 
will be implemented using an incremental model which would be suitable for the development 
of the system as it allows for quick iteration
